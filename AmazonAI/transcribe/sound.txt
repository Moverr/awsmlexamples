Hello, my name is julian, and i live in paris, france. Right now, i'm recording a sound file because i would like to test a new service called amazon transcribed. This file should be long enough to give me a good sample, and hopefully transcribed will be able to understand my french accent. And if not, well, that should make for a pretty funny transcription. This should be long enough by now, so let's, stop the recording, upload that file and get some results.
